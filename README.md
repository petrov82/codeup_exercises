## The Codeup Exercises Folder

[Codeup](http://codeup.com) is an educational company based in San Antonio, TX that offers a 12-week bootcamp and a year-long program to help people who want to become programmers learn the skill necessary to find work in the field of web-based software development.

I am a graduate of the very first cohort, and this folder has a good number of the exercises that we had to complete, as well as some play code from poking around with other languages. There are more exercises in the [codeup.dev repo](https://github.com/petrov82/codeup.dev).
