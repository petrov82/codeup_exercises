	// Hints:
	// - Using conditionals and loops here is important
	// - Random numbers can be made with the internal rand() function
	// - If user is right, tell them they won
	// - While they are wrong, give them hints and keep asking
	// - Use exit(0) to end the game
	// - If you get stuck in game, ctrl-c will exit.
