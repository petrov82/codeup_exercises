The Roman Room

I walked into the Roman room in a slight fog. I was tired. I had gone 3 nights in a row on 4 hours of sleep each night, working on different projects. I needed to relax and unplug. The City museum was a good place to loose time and wander. I had done this many times, with many people.

As I looked up from my obsessive glance to my empty notifications tray in my smartphone, I saw them. Belínda was looking at the female sculpture in the northwest corner of the room. The Blonde Woman was admiring the ancient silver dishware in the opposite corner, and Melissa had her arms crossed, scrutinizing the two-faced busts of gods and couples, standing near The Blonde Woman. This was a fluke. Pure accident. No reason could explain why each one would be in the same room with me, unannounced, unplanned, uncoordinated.

Except me. 

Ana was a shoe-in for going to the Museum. She was a member. Of course, I had been here with her that one time durin.

Melissa had been here before. With me. On a first date. Maybe she just wanted to see the art for what it was, without me–like the Roman Emperor in the middle of the room: without a penis.

I had told The Blonde Woman about the Sully exhibit before. About the woman in the Diego Rivera section. The large mural-sized, life-like painting of the black-haired latina, reclining nude in the morning light. It was not obscene. It was a reflection of a truth. It was not a Good Truth, and it may not even be an evil one either. She was. And She is.

The Blonde Woman had turned around, glowingly, "Peter, I thought I might find you here!"

The Universe was not trying to put us all together. It was getting ready to tear me apart.
